    "She was a shark smile in a yellow van",

    "It came over me at a bad time",
    "But who wouldn't ride on a moonlit line?",
    "I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam",
    "And she said woo",
    "Baby, take me",
    "And I said woo",
    "Baby, take me too",
    "It came over her at a bad time",
    "Riding through Winona down the dotted line",
    "Held us gunning out",
    "90 miles down the road of a dead end dream",
    "She looked over with her part smile",
    "Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile",
    "And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering",
    "As she said woo",
